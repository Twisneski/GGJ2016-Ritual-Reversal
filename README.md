# GGJ2016-Ritual-Reversal

### Our contribution to the 2016 Global Game Jam!

Our vision of a ritual game.

Background: At the beginning of game, Peku finds himself falling off of the top of a pyramid. Falling beside him, are pieces of the crystal heart of his girlfriend, Pichu. In order to make it right, Peku must now retrieve the pieces of Pichu's heart scattered all over the pyramid, and return them to the top.

Game is hosted on itch.io:
